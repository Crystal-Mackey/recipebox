Django is the most popular Python web framework for making user-facing applications, and it's easy to see why. With the famous tagline of "batteries included" and thousands of plugins on PyPI, it makes sense that you can find it in a lot of platforms.

*   The entirety of Instagram is a single monolithic Django app; as of 2016, they leveraged over 50k instances of their software on over 12k machines
*   The grand majority of the Washington Post
*   Most of USA Today and accompanying sites
*   All of Mozilla's support / documentation sites (all that Javascript documentation you were reading a few months ago? That was Django talking!)
*   Disqus comments; the plug-and-play comment system is the most popular system of its type, and it's one giant Django app
*   Most of Atlassian Bitbucket, a competitor to GitHub and Gitlab
*   The entirety of Eventbrite
*   The question-and-answer site Quora

Most of these won't advertise that they're looking for "django developers" because they want to make sure that people can work with their stack; instead, they'll focus on finding "python developers". It's up to us to learn how to leverage Django and its vast ecosystem to handle different types of applications.

#### **Your Task**

For our introduction, we want to get familiar with creating a new Django application. Create a new application that serves recipes from different authors, much like our demo application does for news. Intended layout:

*   An index page that lists all titles of the loaded recipes (they don't have to be real recipes; just fill them with lorem ipsum and some numbers.)
*   Each title is a link that takes you to a single page with the content of that recipe.
*   Each detail view for a recipe has the author name, along with all the information for the recipe arranged in a reasonable format.
*   Clicking on the author's name should take you to an Author Detail page, where you can see a list of all the recipes that the Author has contributed to.
*   Make editing all of the models accessible through the admin panel only.

So we have three types of pages: a simple list view, a recipe detail view, and an author detail view. The admin panel will handle the creation views, so we don't need to worry about that.

**Important Info:**

*   Python 3.9, latest version of Django (3.1.2 as of this writing)
*   Start a project with `django-admin startproject {project name} .` -- note the period at the end! (for example, `django-admin startproject recipebox .`)
*   Start an app with `python manage.py startapp {app name}` (for example, `python manage.py startapp recipe_app`)
*   Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`
*   After you create your models, run `python manage.py makemigrations {foldername}` (where foldername is the top-level folder for your project) to create them, then `python manage.py migrate` to push them to the db. If you get stuck, delete the db and run the command again
*   If you change your models after running the migrations, run makemigrations and migrate again. If the migrations require the creation of a new table, django will automatically handle it
*   Create an admin user by running `python manage.py createsuperuser`
*   Don't go crazy on the front end. The goal is to just handle the database interactions and basic view path
*   Make sure that every detail page (author and recipe) has its own unique URL. If you reload the URL, the same page should appear -- no modals or manipulating the current information on the page. That's too complicated for what we're trying to achieve.
*   REITERATING: There are no extra points for pretty HTML! Don't spend time making everything on the front end look gorgeous; we just want to make sure we're serving the right information.
*   Please don't commit any extraneous files! It's best practice to use a .gitignore file to keep a clean repository. In this project, a .gitignore file is already included.  For future projects, always confirm that a .gitignore file exists in the root directory of your project including the following contents:

Author model:

*   Name (CharField)
*   Bio (TextField)

Recipe Model:

*   Title (CharField)
*   Author (ForeignKey)
*   Description (TextField)
*   Time Required (Charfield) (for example, "One hour")
*   Instructions (TextField)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: Follow PEP8 naming conventions with your models and field names. An easy way to check is by looking at examples of code in Django's docs -->Â [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/#quick-example](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/#quick-example)

If you have any questions or get stuck at any point, don't hesitate to ask. Welcome to a new side of web development!
